# E-commerce Project with Next.js 13.4

This project is part of a course where I had the opportunity to delve into various technologies and tools related to web application development. The main goal of the project was to understand the workings of the following technologies:

- **Next.js:** I used the latest version (13.4) of Next.js to build both the client and server-side of the application.

- **Prisma:** I utilized Prisma for database management, enabling efficient application development.

- **App Router:** I implemented the new app router to provide navigation within the application.

- **Next-Auth:** I addressed user security using Next-Auth and Google authorization.

- **MongoDB:** I chose MongoDB as the database for the project.

- **Vercel:** I deployed the project on the Vercel platform to make it accessible to users.

- **TailwindCSS and DaisyUI:** I improved the user experience by designing responsive and aesthetically pleasing UI.

- **React Cache:** I optimized database query requests using React Cache.

- **Developer Tools:** I configured various tools that facilitated my work during the project development.

This project aims not only to showcase my skills in web application development but also to learn and experiment with new technologies. I am ready for further development and improvement of this project, as well as facing new challenges in programming and designing web applications.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [https://alledrogo-ecommerce-nextjs.vercel.app](https://alledrogo-ecommerce-nextjs.vercel.app) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
